IMVVM
=====

IMVVM helps implement the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) applications. It's role is to provide the framework to create Models and ViewModels, with React acting as the View. It is designed to complement React. The IMVVM API gets its inspiration from the React library. So it feels like React. This makes it easy to understand and enables you to be productive in a short time frame.
