IMVVM Reference Implementation
=====

[IMVVM](https://github.com/entrendipity/imvvm) helps implement the Model-View-ViewModel pattern in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) applications. It's role is to provide the framework to create Models and ViewModels, with React acting as the View. It is designed to complement React. The IMVVM API gets its inspiration from the React library. So it feels like React. This makes it easy to understand and enables you to be productive in a short time frame.

## Setup Example Application
* clone or download repository
* navigate to download directory
* run `grunt serve`

_n.b. The application uses client-side push state and does not reference a server. If you lose the application, navigate to localhost:9000 and not localhost:9000/people to reinitialize the application. This is not how it would work when talking to a remote server._
